**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
This is the first time I have ever written tests for my code. Doing it these past eight weeks has actually been really run and I see how important it is. I can ensure my code is secure by testing. Testing, testing, and more testing. I can ensure it's functional by keeping my coverage 100% and following the requirements of what is asked of me.


**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

User needs aren't always clear to either you or the user. I think focusing on the goal rather than the wants is a good start. From there, communicating and asking questions about any other unknowns that will help get the design process going. Then I can create test cases for the determined needs of the user and potential client. 


**How do I approach designing software?**

Creating tests for each function of the program and run it through tests. Tweak it until all tests pass and then move on. If the tests aren't passing, take a break and come back with rested eyes and a clear head.
